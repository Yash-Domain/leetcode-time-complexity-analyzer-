# Privacy Policy – LeetCode Complexity Analyzer

Last updated: January 2026

LeetCode Complexity Analyzer is a Chrome browser extension designed to analyze
the time and space complexity of solutions written on leetcode.com.

## Information Collection

The extension does NOT collect, track, or store any personally identifiable
information.

The extension may access:
- The code written by the user on a LeetCode problem page
- The problem identifier (slug)

This data is accessed only when the user explicitly clicks the "Analyze" button.

## API Keys (Bring Your Own Key)

Users provide their own API key and model name via the extension settings.

- API keys are never logged, shared, or stored on any server
- API keys are sent only to the user-selected API provider as part of the
  analysis request

## Backend Communication

The extension sends code and problem context to a backend service solely for
the purpose of complexity analysis.

- No data is permanently stored
- No user profiling is performed
- No analytics or tracking is implemented

## Third-Party Services

The extension does not include third-party analytics, advertisements, or
tracking scripts.

## Data Security

All communication between the extension and backend is performed over HTTPS.
